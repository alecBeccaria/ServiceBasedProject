This is how you start on powershell vs CMD
if you are on vscode terminal you are most likely using powershell
run these commands in the ROOT of the project

[POWERSHELL]
cmd.exe /c initdocker.bat

[CMD]
initdocker.bat

STOPPING SWARM
***this also deletes the nodes in the swarm***
[POWERSHELL]
cmd.exe /c DELETEswarm.bat

[CMD]
DELETEswarm.bat
